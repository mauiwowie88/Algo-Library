/*
You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a
different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction.
If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.

/* Algo God Approach
    This is how Zack the Free Man didit.
    Looks like he declared a max var and the currr lowest var
    Loops thru thee array and checks if curr is greaterr than lowest
    If so then subtract the lowest num by curr el store as profit
    Then reassign the max to greater of curr max and cuurr profit
    Else the lowest num is reassigned to curr el
    This is interesting ill have to come back to this
